\subsection*{Overview}

This project implements a material handling robot simulation inspired by an autonomous robot called “\+Butler” originally developed by Grey\+Orange which optimizes goods-\/to-\/\+Person transport. Our approach is to develop a Butler robot simulation in which the robot picks-\/up and delivers objects from and to known stations upon an unknown user or system generated order being issued. Assuming a environment map known at priori, our Butler robot uses the Turtle\+Bot robot as its base platform and uses its distance measurement sensor to dynamically avoid obstacles as it follows its trajectory for delivering object from the collection station to a destination station. The robot starts and ends its delivery cycle at a home or charging station location. The robotic system pre-\/plans a potential optimal trajectory for navigation. To show the successful pick-\/up and delivery of the objects by the robot, at the pickup location the Butler will publish a message indicating the pickup action and the object will disappear from the collection station; similarly, at the destination location the Butler will publish a message indicating the delivery action and the object will appear at the destination location.

\subsection*{Project Design}

The team followed the A\+IP process and pair programming. The A\+IP iteration actions are documented \href{https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1O8GisJ7VpNulYqH-gaPCvG_NAVHMwOyPO4F18fhpBL4/edit?ts=5ddb0c09#gid=0}{\tt here}. The overall project design followed Object-\/\+Oriented programming paradigm. The design is documented in the following \href{./UML/initial/ActivityDiagram.pdf/}{\tt Activity} and \href{./UML/initial/ClassDiagram.pdf}{\tt Class Hierarchy} U\+ML Diagrams. Planning and review notes during each development iteration can be found \href{https://docs.google.com/document/u/0/d/1aiRbswW5R_R5Iiowr5hDhnN0nU_4OwQu9OM1Oh6o9Pk/mobilebasic}{\tt here}
